# Task 5: Clone Method Exploration
### Challenge: 
- Implement the Cloneable interface in the Car class from Task 1. Override clone() to perform a shallow copy. Then, extend it to a deep copy by adding a String[] features field and duplicating it. Test both versions.

### Goal: 
- Compare copy constructors to clone() and practice deep copying with Javaâ€™s built-in mechanism.
