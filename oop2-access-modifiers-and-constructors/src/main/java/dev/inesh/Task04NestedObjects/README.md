# Task 4: Nested Objects
### Challenge: 
- Design a Department class with String name and a List<Employee> (where Employee has String name and int id). Implement both shallow and deep copy constructors. Test both by adding an Employee to the copyâ€™s list and checking the original.

### Goal: 
- Handle complex nested structures and compare shallow vs. deep outcomes.
