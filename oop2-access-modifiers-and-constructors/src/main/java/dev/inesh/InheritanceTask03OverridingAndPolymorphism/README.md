# Task 3: Overriding and Polymorphism
### Challenge: 
- Define an Animal class with a makeSound() method. Create Cat and Dog subclasses that override makeSound() differently. In a Main class, create an array of Animal references containing a Cat and a Dog, and call makeSound() on each.

### Goal: 
- Explore method overriding and runtime polymorphism.

### Expected Output:
```
Meow
Woof
```
